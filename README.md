### Backround

I graduated from Tokyo Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering. I have worked at some of the top firms in the industry, but I have found a new passion in data science. I started coding more often in order to improve my skills. I enjoyed automating tasks we commonly complete manually. My team definitely appreciated that! I started working on predictive analytics projects on my own, even though I wasn't assigned any. I came up with my own ideas, designed a solution, and started implementing them proactively.
